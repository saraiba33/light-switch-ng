# Light Switch (Angular Edition)

!()[https://silly-llama-298eff.netlify.app/]

Create an Angular app that has the following:

- A component called `NightLight` that holds state for whether or not it's on
- A component called `Light`that displays state for whether it's on.
- A component called `Switch` that toggles that state

The `NightLight` component should render the `Light` and `Switch` components. Style the app and deploy it.
